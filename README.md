# Clayton Kershaw Shiny App
A Shiny app to visualise stats and info talked about in The Ringers article, Is Peak Kershaw Gone for Good? By Ben Lindbergh. This was made as my finale assigment for my Data Visualisation class.

The aim for the assignment was to creat a data visual, to help support a news article. The article I chose was [Is Peak Kershaw Gone for Good?, By Ben Lindbergh, The Ringer ](https://www.theringer.com/mlb/2018/5/3/17314506/los-angeles-dodgers-clayton-kershaw-fastball-velocity).

I gathered data mostly from the [pitchRx package](https://github.com/cpsievert/pitchRx), [MLB.com](https://www.mlb.com/), [Baseball Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com/) and [Baseball Savant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/).
